# Contributing to Dandii

Thanks for helping improve Addis Ababa’s transit map and ops console.

## Before you start

1. Read [README.md](./README.md) for local setup (PostGIS, OTP, Next.js, seed).
2. Open an issue (or comment on an existing one) before large features so we can
   align on scope.
3. Security-sensitive discoveries go through [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md), not
   public issues.

## Development workflow

```bash
# From repo root
docker compose up -d postgis otp

cd web
cp .env.example .env   # fill secrets
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

Useful commands (from `web/`):

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | Typecheck |
| `npm test` | Vitest unit / integration tests |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright (needs app + seeded DB; reuses `localhost:3000`) |

Branch off `dev` (or `main` if you are fixing a production hotfix). Keep PRs
focused — one concern per PR when you can.

## Pull requests

- Target **`dev`** for features; use **`main`** only for urgent production fixes
  unless maintainers say otherwise.
- Describe **what** changed and **why** (user impact beats implementation detail).
- Include screenshots or a short clip for UI changes on the public map or console.
- Ensure CI is green: typecheck, lint, unit tests, and (when relevant) the GTFS
  validator gate.
- Do not commit secrets, generated `.gtfs-exports/`, or large binary dumps.
- Follow existing code style: TypeScript, App Router server actions, Untitled UI
  patterns already in the tree. Prefer small, readable diffs over drive-by refactors.

## Commit messages

Use short, imperative subjects with a conventional prefix when it fits:

- `feat:` new user-facing capability
- `fix:` bug fix
- `test:` tests only
- `docs:` documentation
- `chore:` tooling / deps / housekeeping

Example: `feat: library rail for saved and recent searches`

## Data and licensing notes

- The vendored DT4A GTFS feed under `data/gtfs-2026/` remains subject to its
  upstream terms. Dandii application code is under the
  [PolyForm Noncommercial License](./LICENSE): keep the Required Notice /
  credit Rabira Hierpa · Dandii, and do **not** use the work commercially
  without a separate written license from the copyright holder.
- Prefer preserving approved fare data when reseeding (`npm run db:seed`
  defaults to preserve-fares). Do not wipe production-like data casually.

## Code of conduct (short)

Be respectful. Assume good intent. No harassment, hate speech, or personal
attacks. Maintainers may refuse or revert contributions that violate this.
